        <h3>Junior Architect</h3>
        <p>A strong believer in the ability of architecture and its impact on people’s quality <br>
          of life and health, I enjoy cases where architecture has improved people’s quality <br>
          of life and health, I see this being more important in the future to balance the cost <br>
          of buildings including the design against the cost of quality of life, particularly after <br>
          COVID pandemic &#10084; </p>
